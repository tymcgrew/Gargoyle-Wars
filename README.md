# Gargoyle-Wars
A simple side-scroller shooter game, written in Java

To play:    Run/open GargoyleWars.jar



WASD to move your spaceship
Spacebar to fire blaster

They won't attack unless you attack them first!
One gargoyle has the package and you must take them out, but you don't know which one it is.
Good luck!
